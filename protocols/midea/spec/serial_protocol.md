# Midea HVAC Serial Protocol — Command Reference

---

## 1. Scope

This document defines the **serial protocol** — the application-level command set
used between controllers and appliances in Midea HVAC systems. It covers message
types, command bodies, response formats, notifications, and initialization sequences.

The serial protocol is **transport-agnostic**: the same command bodies are carried
by multiple transport framings:

| Transport | Framing Document | Physical Path |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **UART** | [protocol_uart.md](protocol_uart.md) | Wi-Fi dongle ↔ mainboard (CN3) |
| **R/T (Adapterboard for XYE or HA/HB)** | [protocol_rt.md](protocol_rt.md) | Display board ↔ extension board (CN1 R/T pin) |

Each transport wraps the serial protocol body in its own header and integrity
bytes. The body payload (msg_type + body bytes) is byte-for-byte identical
regardless of transport.

## 2. Message Types and Dispatch

### 2.1 Known Serial Protocol Frames

Frames are identified by the combination of **msg_type** (frame byte 9) and
**body[0]** (first body byte). Some msg_types carry the command directly in
body[0]; others are dispatched by msg_type alone (body[0] is payload data,
not a command ID).

The **Captured** column shows approximate frame counts from own hardware
captures (Sessions 1-9, 37,579 total frames, Midea XtremeSaveBlue Q11,
valid CRC). **—** = not yet captured on own hardware.

#### Body[0]-dispatched frames (msg_type 0x02/0x03/0x04/0x05)

These msg_types multiplex several commands via body[0]:

| msg_type | body[0] | Name | Direction | Bus | Captured | Confidence | Section |
|----------|---------|------|-----------|-----|----------|------------|---------|
| `0x02` | `0x40` | Set Status | Dongle→AC | UART, R/T | ~192 | Confirmed | §3.2 |
| `0x02` | `0xB0` | Property Set (TLV) | Dongle→AC | UART | ~24 | Confirmed | §3.5 |
| `0x03` | `0xC0` | Status Response | AC→Dongle | UART, R/T | ~507 | Confirmed | §4.1 |
| `0x03` | `0xC1` | Extended (groups, power) | AC→Dongle | UART, R/T | ~758 | Confirmed | §4.2 |
| `0x03` | `0xB1` | Property Response | AC→Dongle | UART | ~76 | Confirmed | §3.5 |
| `0x03` | `0xB5` | Capabilities (TLV) | AC→Dongle ¹ | UART | ~34 | Confirmed | §3.4 |
| `0x03` | `0x93` | Extension Board Status | Bidir | R/T | ~704 | Confirmed | §3.3 |
| `0x02` | `0x93` | Extension Board Query | Disp→ExtBd | R/T | ~353 | Confirmed | §3.3 |
| `0x02` | `0x41` | Query (status/groups) | Dongle→AC | UART, R/T | ~1100 | Confirmed | §3.1 |
| `0x04` | `0xA1` | Heartbeat (Energy+Temps) | AC→Dongle | UART | ~55 | Confirmed | §5.1 |
| `0x04` | `0xA2` | Heartbeat (Device Params) | AC→Dongle | UART | ~80 | Confirmed | §5.3 |
| `0x04` | `0xA3` | Heartbeat (Device Params 2) | AC→Dongle | UART | ~63 | Confirmed | §5.3 |
| `0x04` | `0xA5` | Heartbeat (Outdoor Unit) | AC→Dongle | UART | ~50 | Confirmed | §5.3 |
| `0x04` | `0xA6` | Heartbeat (Network Info) | AC→Dongle | UART | ~48 | Confirmed | §5.3 |
| `0x05` | `0xA0` | Heartbeat ACK (C0-format) | AC→Dongle ¹ | UART | ~115 | Confirmed | §5.3 |

#### msg_type-dispatched frames (body[0] is payload, not command ID)

| msg_type | Name | Direction | Bus | Captured | Confidence | Section |
|----------|------|-----------|-----|----------|------------|---------|
| `0x07` | Device ID (SN query) | Bidir | UART | 3 | Confirmed | §5.5 |
| `0x0D` | Network Init / SoftAP | Dongle→AC | UART | ~14 | Confirmed | §5.4 |
| `0x63` | Network Status Report | Dongle→AC | UART | ~116 | Confirmed | §5.4 |
| `0x65` | RAC Serial Number | Bidir | UART | 2 | Confirmed | §5.6 |
| `0x64` | OTA / Key Trigger | AC→Dongle | UART | 2 | Observed | — |
| `0xA0` | Proprietary (unknown) | AC→Dongle | UART | 8 | Observed | — |

**¹ Echoed frames**: Heartbeat ACK (0xA0) and Capabilities (0xB5) appear on
**both** UART wires with identical raw bytes. The AC mainboard sends the frame
first (wifiOrange, fromACdisplay); the dongle retransmits the exact same bytes
~50ms later (wifiBrown, toACdisplay) as acknowledgment. All other heartbeat types
(A1-A6) are strictly one-directional (fromACdisplay only). Note: other frame types
(0x63, 0xB0/B1, 0x65) also appear on both wires but as request-response pairs with
**different bytes**. See [protocol_uart.md §4.3](protocol_uart.md) for full analysis.

#### Not yet captured on own hardware

These msg_types are documented from source code analysis (community protocol research) but have not been observed in own captures:

| msg_type | Name | Direction | Confidence |
|----------|------|-----------|------------|
| `0x06` | Status upload (cloud 0x40) | AC→Dongle | Consistent |
| `0x0A` | Error report (cloud 0x44) | AC→Dongle | Consistent |
| `0x0F` | Status transport (cloud 0x20) | AC→Dongle | Consistent |
| `0x11` | Status transport (=0x0F) | AC→Dongle | Consistent |
| `0x13` | Config data (6 bytes) | AC→Dongle | Consistent |
| `0x14` | Accepted (pair w/ 0x15) | AC→Dongle | Consistent |
| `0x15` | Accepted (triggers reboot) | AC→Dongle | Consistent |
| `0x16` | Device event (4-byte data) | Dongle→AC | Consistent |
| `0x61` | Time sync | Dongle→AC | Consistent |
| `0x68` | WiFi config (SSID/password) | AC→Dongle | Consistent |
| `0x6B` | Passthrough (echo) | AC→Dongle | Consistent |
| `0x81`–`0x85` | Mode check / config / ignored | AC→Dongle | Consistent |
| `0x87` | Version info (fixed response) | AC→Dongle | Consistent |
| `0x90` | Exception (reject LEN≤11) | AC→Dongle | Consistent |
| `0x9A` | WiFi version (cloud, not UART) | Dongle→Cloud | Consistent |

**Cloud forwarding** — the dongle forwards certain msg_types to the cloud:

| MSG_TYPE received | Cloud packet type | Description |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 0x04, 0x06 | 0x40 | Status upload |
| 0x05, 0x0A | 0x44 | Error upload |
| 0x0F, 0x11 | 0x20 | Transport upload |

**Silently ignored** msg_types: `0x12`, `0x6A`, `0x6B` (echo), `0x71`, `0x81`, `0x84`, `0x90` (if LEN≤11).

Source: community protocol research.

### 2.2 Response Dispatch

The dissector dispatches incoming frames in two stages: first by **msg_type**
(frame byte 9), then by **body[0]** for the multiplexed types. Priority is
msg_type first — if the msg_type has a dedicated handler, body[0] is treated
as payload data, not a command selector.

| msg_type | body[0] | Decoder | Section |

| `0x07` | *(any)* | Device Identification | §5.5 |
| `0x0D` | *(any)* | Network Init | §5.4 |

## 3. Commands (Dongle → Appliance)

### 3.1 Command 0x41 — Request Variants (query, write, toggle, command)

The 0x41 command is a multiplex carrier for several request types, distinguished
by **body[1]** (sub-command) and **body[2]** (variant selector). Not all
variants are queries — some write data (Follow Me temperature), toggle features
(display), or request lightweight parameter exchanges. The name "query" is
historical from community sources where the status query variant is most common.
Do not conflate with the 0x40 set command.

### Variant table

| body[1] | body[2] | body[3] | body[4] | Type | Name | Expected response |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|------|------|-------------------|
| `0x81` | `0x00` | `0xFF` | `0x00` | query | **Status query** | `0xC0` status response |
| `0x81` | `0x00` | `0xFF` | `0x01` | write | **Follow Me temperature** (R/T only, `body[5]=T*2+50`) — see §3.1.1, §3.1.4.6 | `0xC0` status response |
| `0x81` | `0x01` | page ID | `0x00` | query | **Group dev-param query** (community protocol research) | `0xC1` group page response |
| `0x21` | `0x01` | `0x44` | `0x00` | query | **Power usage query** (Group 4) | `0xC1` Group 4 power response (BCD) |
| `0x21` | varies | varies | optCmd | mixed | **optCommand requests** (community protocol research) — see §3.1.4.3 for per-optCommand type | depends on optCommand |
| `0x61` | `0x00` | `0xFF` | — | toggle | **Display toggle** | — |

### Body layout — note on bus path differences

**R/T bus captures (Session 1, ground truth):**
Body is **23 bytes** — body[4..21] are all `0x00`, body[22] = MSG_ID (sequence counter
added by the R/T bus extension board). The CRC-8 covers all 23 body bytes.

**Community sources (Wi-Fi UART path, not directly captured):**
Body documented as 22 bytes with body[4]=`0x03`, body[5]=`0xFF`, body[7]=`0x02`,
body[20]=`0x03`, body[21]=MSG_ID. These extra non-zero bytes may be specific to the
Wi-Fi UART path or to a different firmware generation.
**Disputed** — the R/T captures show all zeros in those positions. Do not assume
the Wi-Fi path uses the same values until captured directly.

#### 3.1.1 Status query (body[1]=sub-cmd 0x81, body[2]=variant 0x00) → Response: §4.1 (0xC0)

Triggers a full `0xC0` status response (§4.1). Captured on R/T bus in Session 1.

```
Body (23 bytes on R/T bus):
  [0]  0x41  command ID
  [1]  0x81  sub-command
  [2]  0x00  variant: status query
  [3]  0xFF
  [4..21]  0x00 (R/T bus; community sources show non-zero on Wi-Fi path — see above)
  [22] MSG_ID  sequence counter (R/T bus extra byte)
```

Captured frame (R/T bus, body shown, bytes 11..33 of 38-byte frame):
```
41 81 00 FF 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 36
```

**R/T Follow Me temperature variant**: When Follow Me is active, the R/T bus
repurposes `body[4]` to carry optCommand=0x01 (Follow Me temperature) within
the standard query frame. The frame structure is identical except
`body[4]=0x01` and `body[5]=T*2+50`. This is an R/T-specific variant — the
UART bus uses the extended format (`body[1]=0x21`) for optCommand, while the
R/T bus uses the standard format (`body[1]=0x81`). See §3.1.4.6 for encoding
details and §3.1.4.6 "Cross-bus comparison" table for differences between buses.

Captured frame (R/T bus, Session 7, Follow Me active at 24°C):
```
41 81 00 FF 01 62 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 XX
               ^^ body[4]=0x01 (optCommand: Follow Me temperature)
                  ^^ body[5]=0x62 → (98-50)/2 = 24.0°C
```

This variant is sent by the busadapter (busadapter → display) once per R/T
polling cycle while Follow Me is active. It stops during idle periods when
Follow Me is off but reappears briefly during operator actions (stale
temperature). See `analysis_follow_me_serial.md` §5 for full evidence.

#### 3.1.2 Capability page query (body[1]=sub-cmd 0x81, body[2]=variant 0x01, body[3]=pageID) → Response: §4.2 (0xC1 group pages)

Selects a config/capability page for the extension board or wall controller.
Triggers a `0xC1` group page response (not a `0xC0` status response).
Observed pages: `0x41`, `0x42`, `0x43`, `0x45`. Used in the R/T bus polling cycle.

**Cross-reference**: community protocol research (see community protocol research):
These group pages correspond to a group-based "device development parameter" system.
The response dispatches by `body[3] & 0x0F` as group number:
page 0x41 → Group 1 (base run info), page 0x42 → Group 2 (indoor device params),
page 0x43 → Group 3 (outdoor device params), page 0x44 → Group 4 (power),
page 0x45 → Group 5 (extended params). **Hypothesis** — field labels from single
source, not yet verified against own captures at field level.

```
Body (23 bytes on R/T bus):
  [0]  0x41  command ID
  [1]  0x81  sub-command
  [2]  0x01  variant: group page query
  [3]  page  page ID (0x41 / 0x42 / 0x43 / 0x45 observed)
  [4..21]  0x00
  [22] MSG_ID
```

Captured request frames (R/T bus):
```
Page 0x41:  41 81 01 41 00...00 9A
Page 0x42:  41 81 01 42 00...00 24
Page 0x43:  41 81 01 43 00...00 AC
```
Note: page 0x45 had 5 response frames in Session 1 but no corresponding `41 81 01 45`
request was found — possibly a spontaneous / pushed response. **Unknown.**

For group page response field details, see §4.2 (0xC1 Group Pages).

---

#### 3.1.3 Power usage query (body[1]=sub-cmd 0x21, body[2]=variant 0x01, body[3]=page 0x44) → Response: §4.2.4 (0xC1 Group 4 power)

Triggers a `0xC1` power BCD response. See §4.2.1 for response parsing.

```
Body (22 bytes, community sources):
  [0]  0x41   command ID
  [1]  0x21   sub-command: power/extended
  [2]  0x01
  [3]  0x44   power page marker
  [4..20]  0x00
  [21] 0x04
  [22] MSG_ID
```

#### 3.1.4 optCommand requests (body[4]=optCommand) — queries, pushes, and commands

The optCommand mechanism selects query variants (Follow Me temperature push,
extended state query, engineering modes) via `body[4]`. It appears in two
frame formats depending on bus:

- **UART**: Extended query (`body[1]=0x21`, 24-byte frame) — documented in
  community protocol research and community research
- **R/T**: Standard query (`body[1]=0x81`, 38-byte frame) with `body[4]`
  repurposed — own captures, Sessions 4, 5, 7 (see §3.1.1 for hex example)

Confidence: optCommand 0x01 and 0x03 are **Consistent** (multi-source: community protocol research + own R/T captures). All other optCommand values are **Hypothesis** (single source within community protocol research, not verified on hardware).

##### 3.1.4.1 UART extended frame layout (body[1]=sub-cmd 0x21, 24 bytes)

```
Offset  Value               Field
------  -----               -----
  0     0xAA                Start byte
  1     0x17                Length = 23 (counts bytes [1..23])
  2     0xAC                Appliance type
  3-8   0x00 x6             Reserved / device address
  9     0x03                msg_type = query
 10     0x41                body[0]: command ID
 11     sound<<6 | 0x21     body[1]: buzzer flag (bit 6) + sub-cmd 0x21
 12     0x00                body[2]
 13     0xFF                body[3]
 14     optCommand          body[4]: selects query variant (see table below)
 15     (varies)            body[5]: payload — depends on optCommand
 16     (varies)            body[6]: specKey — depends on optCommand
 17     (varies)            body[7]: queryStat — depends on optCommand
 18-20  0x00 x3             body[8-10]: reserved
 21     order               body[11]: frame sequence number (incrementing)
 22     CRC8                CRC-8/854 over body bytes [0..11]
 23     CHK                 Two's complement of sum of bytes [1..22]
```

**body[1] bit 6 — Buzzer control**: `body[1] = sound << 6 | 0x21`, where `sound` = 0 (silent)
or 1 (beep). This is one of three independent buzzer mechanisms:

| Path | Location | Value |
|------|----------|-------|
| 0x40 set command | body[1] bit 6 | BYTE_BUZZER_ON = 0x40 |
| Extended 0x41 | body[1] bit 6 | `sound << 6 \| 0x21` |
| Standard 0x41 | body[1] bit 6 | `0x81` or `0xC1` (bit 6 = buzzer) |
| 0xB0 property | property 0x1A, 0x00 | 0x00=off, 0x01=on |

**Own captures — buzzer behavior differs by source:**

| Bus | Command | body[1] bit 6 | Beep? | Frames | Why |
|-----|---------|---------------|-------|--------|-----|
| UART (Wi-Fi dongle) | 0x40 Set | **1** (0x42) | **yes** | 11/11 (Session 8) | App has no speaker — requests AC display board to beep as audio feedback |
| R/T (wall controller) | 0x40 Set | 0 (0x01) | no | 0/78 (Sessions 4-8) | KJR-120M has its own speaker and beeps locally — requesting AC beep would cause double-beep |
| R/T (wall controller) | 0x41 Query | 0 (0x81) | no | 0/937 | Queries never trigger beep |
| UART (Wi-Fi dongle) | 0x41 Query | 0 (0x21) | no | 0/11 | Queries never trigger beep |

The buzzer bit is a **per-command flag**, not a global setting. Each source
decides whether to request a beep based on whether it has its own audio
feedback. The Wi-Fi dongle always requests a beep on SET commands; the wall
controller never does.

##### 3.1.4.2 Comparison: Standard (body[1]=sub-cmd 0x81) vs Extended (body[1]=sub-cmd 0x21)

| Aspect | Standard 0x41 | Extended 0x41 |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Frame length | 35 bytes (0x23) | 24 bytes (0x17) |
| body[1] | 0x81 | 0x21 (+ buzzer bit 6) |
| body[4] | 0x00 or optCommand *** | optCommand (selects variant) |
| body[7] | 0x02 (fixed) | queryStat (when optCommand=0x03) |
| Response type | 0xC0 status | 0xC1 extended (sub-pages 0x01 + 0x02) |
| Body length | 22-23 bytes | 12 bytes |

*** **R/T bus exception**: On the R/T extension board bus, the standard 0x41
(`body[1]=0x81`) repurposes `body[4]` to carry the optCommand — specifically
`body[4]=0x01` with `body[5]=T*2+50` for Follow Me temperature. The extended
format (`body[1]=0x21`) was never observed on the R/T bus (Sessions 3–9).
See `analysis_follow_me_serial.md` §5 for evidence.

##### 3.1.4.3 optCommand table (body[4]=optCommand, body[5..9]=payload)

On the UART bus, optCommand values use the 24-byte extended frame (`body[1]=0x21`).
On the R/T bus, optCommand=0x01 (Follow Me temperature) was observed in the
standard 38-byte query (`body[1]=0x81`) — see §3.1.1. The payload encoding
(`body[5..9]`) is the same in both formats:

| optCommand | Type | Purpose | body[5] | body[6] | body[7] | body[8] | body[9] | Confidence |
|------------|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|------------|
| 0x00 | query | Sync / normal extended query | 0xFF | 0x00 | 0x00 | 0x00 | 0x00 | Hypothesis |
| **0x01** | **write** | **Follow Me temperature** | `bodyTemp * 2 + 50` | 0x00 | 0x00 | 0x00 | 0x00 | **Consistent** |
| 0x02 | command | Special function key | 0xFF | specKey | 0x00 | 0x00 | 0x00 | Hypothesis |
| **0x03** | **query** | **Query extended state** | 0xFF | 0x00 | queryStat | 0x00 | 0x00 | **Consistent** |
| 0x04 | command | Installation position | 0xFF | 0x00 | 0x00 | instPos | 0x00 | Hypothesis |
| 0x05 | command | Engineering / test mode | 0xFF | 0x00 | 0x00 | 0x00 | testMode | Hypothesis |
| 0x06 | command | Max cool/heat freq limit | 0xFF | 0x00 | 0x00 | 0x00 | OR bit 7 | Hypothesis |

Note: optCommand 0x04 places its payload at **body[8]** (not body[7]). optCommand 0x05
uses **body[9]**. optCommand 0x06 OR's `(maxCoolHeat & 0x01) << 7` into body[9] bit 7.
Source: community protocol research.
optCommand values 0x04-0x06 are single-source and unverified on hardware.

##### 3.1.4.4 Direct C1 sub-page query (body[1]=sub-page 0x01/0x02, 14 bytes) → Response: §4.3 (0xC1 extended state)

An alternative to optCommand=0x03 — a shorter **14-byte frame** that requests a specific
C1 sub-page directly by number:

```
Offset  Value           Field
  0     0xAA            Start
  1     0x0D            Length = 13 (14 bytes total)
  2     0xAC            Appliance type
  3-8   0x00 x6         Reserved
  9     0x03            msg_type
 10     0x41            body[0]: command
 11     0x01 or 0x02    body[1]: sub-page number (0x01 or 0x02)
 12     CRC8            CRC-8/854
 13     CHK             Checksum
```

This bypasses the optCommand/queryStat mechanism entirely. The response is the same
0xC1 sub-page as triggered by optCommand=0x03.

Source: community protocol research. **Hypothesis**.

##### 3.1.4.5 queryStat values (body[7]=queryStat when body[4]=optCommand 0x03) → Response: §4.3 (0xC1 extended state)

| queryStat | Purpose | Response |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| 0x00 | Invalid | — |
| 0x01 | Exit query mode | — |
| 0x02 | Extended state query | 0xC1 sub-pages 0x01 + 0x02 (see §4.2.3, §4.2.4) |
| 0x03 | Outdoor-focused query | Unknown response format |

##### 3.1.4.6 Follow Me temperature write (body[4]=optCommand 0x01, body[5]=bodyTemp T*2+50) → Response: §4.1 (0xC0)

This is a **write** (not a query) — it sends the room temperature to the unit,
overriding the unit's own thermistor. The unit acknowledges with a 0xC0 response. When Follow Me is enabled (via 0x40 set command body[8] bit 7 = 1), the remote or
phone periodically sends its measured room temperature using optCommand=0x01.

**Temperature encoding**:
```
encoded  = bodyTemp_celsius * 2 + 50
bodyTemp = (encoded - 50) / 2

Range: 0-50 C (encoded 0x32-0x96)
```

**Worked example** (22 C, buzzer off, sequence=0):
```
AA 17 AC 00 00 00 00 00 00 03  41 21 00 FF 01 5E 00 00 00 00 00 00  <CRC> <CHK>
                                            ^^ optCommand=0x01 (Follow Me)
                                               ^^ 22*2+50 = 94 = 0x5E
```

**R/T bus variant** (own captures, Sessions 4, 5, 7 — confirmed): The R/T bus
uses the standard query format (`body[1]=0x81`, 38-byte frame) with `body[4]`
repurposed to carry optCommand=0x01. Same temperature encoding (`body[5]=T*2+50`)
as the UART extended format. See §3.1.1 for hex example and
`analysis_follow_me_serial.md` §5 for full cross-session verification.

**Cross-bus comparison — Follow Me temperature encoding**:

| Bus | Frame | Encoding | Example: 22 C |
|-----|-------|----------|---------------|
| UART extended 0x41 (`body[1]=0x21`) | 24-byte, body[4]=optCommand | `T * 2 + 50` | 0x5E (94) |
| R/T standard 0x41 (`body[1]=0x81`) | 38-byte, body[4]=optCommand | `T * 2 + 50` | 0x5E (94) |
| XYE C6 byte[11] | 16-byte command | direct Celsius | 0x16 (22) |
| XYE C3 byte[8] (setpoint context) | 16-byte command | `T + 0x40` | 0x56 (86) |
| R/T 0xC0 body[11] (readback) | 38-byte response | `(raw - 50) / 2` | 0x5E (94) |

The UART and XYE encodings differ. See `protocol_xye.md` §0.4a for the XYE Follow-Me mechanism.

##### 3.1.4.7 Follow Me — cross-command overview

Follow Me uses **two separate commands** working together:

| Step | Command | Field | Type | Section |
|------|---------|-------|------|---------|
| 1. Enable | **0x40 Set** (§3.2) | body[8] bit 7 = 1 | write | §3.2 body[8] |
| 2. Temperature | **0x41 optCommand=0x01** (§3.1.4.6) | body[5] = T*2+50 | write | §3.1.4.6 |
| Readback | **0xC0 Response** (§4.1) | body[8] bit 7, body[11] = T1 | response | §4.1 |

The enable flag is part of the 0x40 Set command (§3.2), not the 0x41 request.
The temperature write is an 0x41 optCommand (§3.1.4.6). They are sent as
separate frames — see `analysis_follow_me_serial.md` for the full lifecycle.

For the three body-sensing feature types (Follow Me vs localBodySense vs
wisdomEye), see §3.2 body[8]/body[9] field notes.

##### 3.1.4.8 Hex template (optCommand=0x03, queryStat=0x02, extended state query)

```
AA 17 AC 00 00 00 00 00 00 03  41 21 00 FF 03 FF 00 02 00 00 00 NN  <CRC> <CHK>
                                            ^^ optCommand=0x03
                                                     ^^ queryStat=0x02
                                                              ^^ NN=sequence
```

**Dissector note**: The dissector recognizes `body[1]=0x21` and shows the raw `optCommand`
value but does not decode optCommand names, Follow Me temperature, or queryStat values.
Enhancement opportunity.

#### 3.1.5 Display toggle (body[1]=sub-cmd 0x61)

```python
display_toggle_body = [
    0x41, 0x61, 0x00, 0xFF, 0x02, 0x00, 0x02, 0x00,

### Operating Modes (bits [7:5] of body byte 2):
```python
MODE_AUTO      = 1   # 0b001  (0x20 masked to bits[7:5])
MODE_COOL      = 2   # 0b010  (0x40)
MODE_DRY       = 3   # 0b011  (0x60)
MODE_HEAT      = 4   # 0b100  (0x80)
MODE_FAN_ONLY  = 5   # 0b101  (0xA0)
MODE_SMART_DRY = 6   # 0b110  (0xC0) — confirmed (BYTE_MODE_SMART_DRY)
```
All six values are confirmed consistent between `protocol_uart.md` existing sources
and community protocol research.

### Fan Speed Values (body byte 3):
```python
FAN_AUTO   = 102  # 0x66 — Consistent (BYTE_FANSPEED_AUTO)
FAN_SILENT = 20   # 0x14 — Consistent (BYTE_FANSPEED_MUTE)
FAN_LOW    = 40   # 0x28 — Consistent (BYTE_FANSPEED_LOW)
FAN_MEDIUM = 60   # 0x3C — Consistent (BYTE_FANSPEED_MID)
FAN_HIGH   = 80   # 0x50 — Consistent (BYTE_FANSPEED_HIGH)
FAN_TURBO  = 100  # 0x64 — from existing sources; Lua does not list separately
```
Source: community protocol research.

**Capability-dependent encoding:** These fixed level values apply to devices with
B5 cap 0x10 = 3–7 (discrete steps). Devices with cap 0x10 = 1 (stepless) accept
any value 0–100 in body[3] bits[6:0] as a raw percentage. Value 101 = fixed
(system-controlled), 102 = auto. See the cap 0x10 map in §3.4 and
`protocol_shared.md` §6.1 for cross-bus behaviour. Hardware evidence: Session 11
on XtremeSaveBlue (cap 0x10 = 1). **[Confirmed]** — community protocol research .

### Swing Mode (body byte 7, lower nibble):
```python
SWING_OFF        = 0b0000  # 0x00 — Consistent (BYTE_SWING_LR_OFF + BYTE_SWING_UD_OFF)
SWING_VERTICAL   = 0b1100  # 0x0C — Consistent (BYTE_SWING_UD_ON)
SWING_HORIZONTAL = 0b0011  # 0x03 — Consistent (BYTE_SWING_LR_ON)
SWING_BOTH       = 0b1111  # 0x0F — derived (both bits combined)
```
Bits [5:4] of byte 7 are set to `0x30` as a constant in the control command —
the swing nibbles are OR'd with 0x30: `byte[7] = swingLR | swingUD | 0x30`.

A secondary horizontal swing flag `BYTE_SWING_LR_UNDER_ON = 0x80` (for "under" units)
is documented at byte 7 bit 7. This is a feature variant not yet observed in own
captures — treat as Hypothesis.

### Temperature Setting (dudanov's approach):
```python
def set_target_temp(body, temp_celsius):
    """Set target temperature with 0.5C resolution."""
    tmp = int(temp_celsius * 4) + 1
    integer = tmp // 4
    # New temperature field (byte 18 of body)
    body[18] = (integer - 12) & 0x1F
    # Legacy temperature field (byte 2 of body)
    integer_legacy = integer - 16
    if integer_legacy < 1 or integer_legacy > 14:
        integer_legacy = 1
    half_degree = (tmp & 2) << 3  # bit 4 = 0.5C flag
    body[2] = (body[2] & 0xE0) | half_degree | integer_legacy
```

#### 3.1.6 Lightweight parameter query (CMDTYPE_QUERY_PAR)

A shorter **17-byte frame** for parameter queries. Uses the same body[1]=0x21 sub-command
but with only 5 body bytes:

```
Offset  Value               Field
  0     0xAA                Start
  1     0x10                Length = 16 (17 bytes total)
  2     type                Appliance type (0xAC)
  3-7   0x00                Reserved
  8     0x02                (differs from standard 0x00)
  9     0x03                msg_type = query
 10     0x41                body[0]: command
 11     sound<<6 | 0x21     body[1]: buzzer + sub-cmd
 12     0x01                body[2]
 13     optCommand          body[3]: sub-operation
 14     order               body[4]: sequence number
 15     CRC8                CRC-8/854 over body[0..4]
 16     CHK                 Checksum
```

Note: byte[8] is 0x02 (not 0x00 as in standard frames).

**Unimplemented command types**: The following CMDTYPEs are defined in the app code but
have no frame builder — they are reserved for future features or device-specific variants:
CMDTYPE_SET_FILTER (100), CMDTYPE_GET_FILTER_RESULT (101), CMDTYPE_RESET_FILTER (102),
CMDTYPE_START_WEATHER_VOICE (200), CMDTYPE_SET_VOICE (201).

### 3.2 Command 0x40 — Set Status → Response: §4.1 (0xC0)

### Body layout (offsets relative to body start = frame offset 10):

The body is 26 bytes (indices 0-25), making the full frame 36 bytes.

```
Body    Frame

**Three body-sensing feature types** — similar-sounding names for distinct features:

| Feature | Field name | Location | Function |
|---------|------------|----------|----------|
| **Follow Me** | `bodySense` | body[8] bit 7 (SET + RSP) | Overrides the unit's measured temperature with an external value sent via IR remote or serial interface (phone/controller). The unit uses this temperature for its control loop instead of its own thermistor. Temperature written via 0x41 optCommand=0x01 (§3.1.4.6). |
| **Local body sense** | `localBodySense` | body[9] bit 7 (RSP only, §4.1) | Occupancy sensor — detects/tracks a person in the room. Exact behavior unknown. Only on models with a built-in sensor. **Hypothesis** — OQ-17. |
| **Wisdom Eye** | `wisdomEye` | body[9] bit 0 (SET) | Occupancy sensor — detects/tracks a person in the room. Exact behavior unknown. Only on models with a built-in sensor. |

Our test unit (XtremeSave Blue) does not have a built-in occupancy sensor
(body[9] bit 7 = 0x00 in all captures).

 10      20     bit 0       Sleep mode
                bit 1       Turbo mode (another location)
                bit 2       Temperature unit (0=C, 1=F) — **Confirmed** (own captures,
                            logic analyzer Session 10). The app sets this bit to switch
                            between Celsius and Fahrenheit display. All other temperature
                            fields in the frame remain Celsius-internal; only this flag
                            changes.
                bit 3       Catch cold
                bit 4       Night light
                bit 5       Peak elec
                bit 6       Dust full
                bit 7       Clean fan time

Same layout as §4.1 body[10]. The dissector previously only decoded bits 0-1
(Sleep, Turbo); bit 2 (Unit) was added in Session 10 analysis.

**Validated from captures (Sessions 1 and 8, UART bus):**

> **CORRECTION (2026-04-06):** Q11 XtremeSaveBlue uses **linear encoding**
> (big-endian uint32 / 100), not BCD. The previous "confirmed BCD" values
> (111-113 kWh) were wrong — linear decoding gives ~688-690 kWh, confirmed

| Session | totalPowerConsume (linear) | totalPowerConsume (BCD, wrong) | Conditions |
|---------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| 1 (t≈9s) | **688.39 kWh** | ~~111.45 kWh~~ | Compressor off, standby |
| 8 (t≈42s) | **690.03 kWh** | ~~113.81 kWh~~ | Compressor running ~80 Hz, heat mode |

Cumulative increase Session 1→8: ~1.64 kWh (linear). The encoding format
(BCD vs linear) is determined by B5 capability 0x16: values 2-3 = BCD,
values 4-5 = linear. Q11 reports cap 0x16 = 0 ("not supported") but the
data is present and uses linear encoding. See `serial_glossary.yaml`
capability section for details.

### 3.3 Command 0x93 — Extension Board / Wall Controller Status → Response: §4.4 (0x93)

Observed on R/T bus (HA/HB via MFB-X, bidirectionalExtensionBoard) in Sessions 1–11.
Appears in both request and response direction. Not documented in any open-source
UART implementation — specific to the KJR/extension board bus path.

Requests use msg_type `0x03` (poll) or `0x02` (active trigger). Responses echo msg_type.

See `analysis_0x93_extension_board.md` for the full cross-session analysis
(cold boot, power on/off, window contact CP, state machine diagrams).

### Request body (23 bytes, R/T bus)

```
[0]   0x93  command ID
[1]   flags — bus adapter state:
        bit 7 (0x80): periodic alternating flag (~every 3 cycles, all sessions)
        bit 5 (0x20): window contact open (MFB-X dry contact)
                      0xA0 = initial trigger (bit 7 + bit 5, one frame per event)
        Consistent (logic analyzer Sessions 1–11)
[2]   0x80  fixed (all sessions)
[3]   status — operational state:
        0x00 = OFF
        0x01 = cold boot pre-handshake (S9 only)
        0x04 = protection / standby (CP trigger, or cold boot initial)
        0x80 = recovery (contact closed, restarting)
        0x81 = cold boot stage 1
        0x82 = cold boot stage 3
        0x84 = normal running
        0x90 = boot intermediate / mode transition
        Consistent (logic analyzer Sessions 4, 9, 11)
[4]   FM — 0x00 (no Follow Me) or 0x05 (Follow Me active/capable)
        Hypothesis (S10/S11 = 0x05, S1/S3/S4/S9 = 0x00)
[5..21]  0x00
[22]  MSG_ID — incrementing message counter
```

Request variants captured:
```
Poll (msg_type=0x03):     93 00 80 84 05 00...00 81  (normal, FM active)
Trigger (msg_type=0x02):  93 A0 80 84 05 00...00 C3  (window contact open)
Periodic (msg_type=0x03): 93 80 80 84 05 00...00 B5  (alternating flag)
```

### 3.4 Command 0xB5 — Capabilities Query → Response: §4.5 (0xB5)

Two protocol generations exist for capability discovery. The device's `dataType` field
determines which format is used:
- **New protocol** (`dataType == 0x03`, msg_type = 0x03): TLV record structure (documented below)
- **Old protocol** (`dataType == 0x05`, msg_type = 0x05): Fixed-format cursor-based block (see end of section)

Source for old protocol: community protocol research.

#### 3.4.1 New Protocol B5 (TLV format, msg_type=0x03)

### Request Body:
```python
# First capabilities query:
cap_query_1 = [0xB5, 0x01, 0x11]
# + CRC8 appended

# Second capabilities query (for additional capabilities):
cap_query_2 = [0xB5, 0x01, 0x01, 0x00]
# + CRC8 appended
```

### Full frame (reneklootwijk-style):
```python
cap_frame = bytearray([
    0xAA, 0x00, 0xAC, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x03, 0x03,
    0xB5, 0x01, 0x00,  # byte 12 = 0x00 for first query
    0x00, 0x00  # CRC + checksum
])
```

### B5 Response Parsing:

Response body[0] = `0xB5`. Structure:
```
body[1] = number of capability records
body[2..] = capability records
```

Each capability record:
```
Offset  Field
  0     Capability ID (low byte)
  1     Capability type: 0x00 = simple, 0x02 = extended
  2     Data length (N)
  3..   Data bytes (N bytes)
```

Record iteration: `i += 3 + data_length`

### Capability IDs:

B5 capabilities define which UI elements the Midea app presents. They do **not**
restrict the protocol — the device accepts any valid command regardless of its
advertised capabilities.

#### Wind speed map (cap 0x10):

This value selects the fan speed control mode shown in the Midea app UI.

| val | Control type          | Available speed buttons |
|-----|-----------------------|------------------------|
| 0   | Disabled              | (none) |
| 1   | **Stepless (slider)** | Percentage 0–100 % (continuously variable) |
| 2   | Disabled              | (none) |
| 3   | Discrete steps        | Low, High |
| 4   | Discrete steps        | Low, High, Auto |
| 5   | Discrete steps        | Low, Mid, High, Auto (standard) |
| 6   | Discrete steps        | Mute, Low, Mid, High, Auto |
| 7   | Discrete steps        | Low, Mid, High |

Note: some third-party implementations treat val=1 as "not supported" (inverted
boolean). This is incorrect — val=1 means stepless/continuously variable speed,
not "no fan speed control".

**Effect on UART encoding:** This capability value directly determines how body[3]
bits[6:0] is interpreted in 0x40 Set and 0xC0 Status commands. For val=1
(stepless), body[3] carries a raw 0–100 percentage. For val=3–7 (discrete),
body[3] carries fixed level constants (20/40/60/80/100/102). The protocol byte
format is identical — the capability gates the UI only, not the wire encoding.
The XYE bus is unaffected — it always uses one-hot bitmask encoding. See
`protocol_shared.md` §6.1 for the full cross-bus analysis. Source:

#### 3.4.2 Old Protocol B5 (Fixed format, msg_type=0x05)

Source: community protocol research.
All fields: **Hypothesis** — single source, not verified against own captures.

Older devices respond with msg_type=0x05 and body[0]=0xB5. The response body uses a
fixed-format cursor-based layout rather than TLV records. A `cursor` pointer starts at
body[1] (property[0]):

| cursor+N | Field | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| +5 | Power / mode / temp | Bit-packed, device-variant-specific |
| +7 | Fan speed | bits[6:0] |
| +8 | On-timer | Same encoding as 0xC0 |
| +9 | Off-timer | Same encoding as 0xC0 |
| +10 | Timer minutes | Same encoding as 0xC0 |
| +12 | Strong wind, sleep, power-saving | Various bits |
| +13 | PTC, secondary LR swing (under-unit) | |
| +14 | Natural wind | bit 6 (dataType=0x05 only) |
| +15 | Screen display, PMV | |
| +18 | No-wind-sense, prevent-straight-wind | |
| +19 | t2_heat threshold | See protocol docs |
| +20 | tp_heat threshold | See protocol docs |
| +21 | UD vane swing angle | bits[3:0] |
| +22 | Prevent super-cool (bit 6), fresh air (bit 7) | |
| +23 | Degerming | |
| +27 | Rewarming dry, PTC default rule, light sensitive | |
| +28 | Right fan wind speed | |
| +29-30 | Indoor CO2 | 16-bit LE |
| +31 | No-wind-sense L/R, moisturizing, linkage, linkage sync | |
| +36-41 | Fresh air mode, purifier mode, humidity | Only if body >= 33 bytes |
| +42 | Linkage fan speed | |
| +44 | Indoor temperature (integer) | |
| +45 | Indoor temperature (fractional, bits[3:0]) | |

**Extended B5 fields** (community research, cursor offsets for body >= 33 bytes):

| cursor+N | Field | Encoding |
|----------|-------|----------|
| +23 | degerming | bit 1 |
| +25 | aromatherapy (arom_old) | bit 7 |
| +27 | rewarming_dry (bit 1), ptc_default_rule (bit 5), light_sensitive (bits[7:6]) | |
| +31 | whirl_wind_right (bit 3), whirl_wind_left (bit 2) | |

| +41 | five_dimension_mode (bits[1:0]), wind_no_linkage (bit 4) | |
| +42 | linkage_fan_speed | bits[6:0] |

Source: community protocol research. **Hypothesis**.

**deviceSN8 variant temperature decoding** (community research): In old-protocol B5 responses
(dataType=0x05), the temperature field in body[1] uses different bit positions depending
on the device variant (identified by characters 13-17 of the serial number):

| Variant | Temperature bits | Half-degree bit | Models |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| CA models | `(body[1] & 0x7C) >> 2` + 12 | bit 1 | SN8: 11447, 11451, 11453, 11455, 11457, 11459, 11525, 11527, 11533, 11535 |
| All others | `(body[1] & 0x3E) >> 1` + 12 | bit 6 | Including Q11 (XtremeSaveBlue) |

Both variants produce the same range (12-43 C) but from different bit positions.

**Query frames**: Two pages sent sequentially:
- Page 1: `B5 01 00` (body[1]=0x01, body[2]=0x00)
- Page 2: `B5 01 01 01 21` (body[1]=0x01, body[2]=0x01, body[3]=0x01, body[4]=0x21)

**Dissector note**: The dissector does not currently distinguish old vs new B5 format
or deviceSN8 variants.

### 3.5 Command 0xB0/0xB1 — Property Protocol (newer devices) → Response: §4.6 (0xB1)

Source: community protocol research.
All fields: **Hypothesis** — single source within community protocol research, not verified against own captures.

A newer "property" protocol that supplements the 0x40/0x41 command set for features
not covered by the fixed-format body (indirect wind, breeze, fresh air, screen display).

#### Frame structure

**Property query** (0xB1, msg_type=0x03):
```
body[0] = 0xB1
body[1] = N_props (number of properties to query)
body[2..] = property IDs (2 bytes each: lo, hi)
```

**Property control** (0xB0, msg_type=0x02):
```
body[0] = 0xB0
body[1] = N_props
body[2..] = TLV entries: prop_id_lo, prop_id_hi, data_len, value_bytes...
```

**Response**: Same body[0] (0xB0 or 0xB1), TLV entries carry current values.

#### Known Property IDs

Property IDs are 2-byte little-endian (`lo, hi`):

| ID (lo, hi) | Name | data_len | Values / Notes |

## 4. Responses (Appliance → Dongle)

### 4.1 Response 0xC0 — Current AC Status ← Triggered by: §3.1.1 (0x41 status query), §3.2 (0x40 set), §3.1.4.6 (Follow Me temp)

The AC responds to 0x40 (set) and 0x41 (query) with a **0xC0** response.

**0xA0 variant**: msg_type `0x05` with body[0] = `0xA0` uses the same field layout
as `0xC0`. Purpose unknown — treat as Hypothesis.
Source: community protocol research.

**Multi-unit / new protocol detection**:
- `body[0] == 0xBC` or `0xBA` → multi-unit protocol variant
- `body[0] == 0xBF` → "new protocol" variant
These trigger alternate parsing paths. Not yet seen in own captures.
Source: community protocol research.

Response data starts at frame offset 10. The response `data[0]` = `0xC0`.
All byte references below are **relative to body start** (body[0] = `0xC0`).

**body[8] bit 7 — Follow Me active (bodySense)**: When set, indicates the unit is using
the remote/phone temperature as the room reference instead of its own sensor. See §3.1.4.6
for the Follow Me temperature push mechanism and §3.1.4.7 for the enable/readback table.
**Confirmed** — own R/T captures (Sessions 3–8) + community protocol research.

**body[14] bits[3:0] — PMV (Predicted Mean Vote)**: A thermal comfort index based on the
ISO 7730 / ASHRAE 55 PMV scale. Encoding: `pmv = (bits[3:0]) * 0.5 - 3.5`.
Source: reneklootwijk/node-mideahvac. **Consistent** (node-mideahvac + community protocol research reference agree).

| Raw (bits[3:0]) | PMV value | Description |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| 0 | 99 (off) | PMV disabled |
| 1 | -3.0 | Cold |
| 2 | -2.5 | Chill |
| 3 | -2.0 | Chill |
| 4 | -1.5 | Cool |

| 9 | 1.0 | Slightly warm |
| 10 | 1.5 | Slightly warm |
| 11 | 2.0 | Warm |
| 12 | 2.5 | Warm |

Value 0 = "99" in node-mideahvac represents PMV disabled / not active.

**body[14] bits[6:4] — Display state**: **Disputed** between sources:
- This document + dissector: `bits[6:4] == 0x7` → display ON
- midea-local: `bits[6:4] != 0x7` → display ON (inverted logic), also gated on power ON

Requires hardware verification. See Appendix A.

**body[22] — Silky cool**: This byte only exists when the response body is at least 23 bytes.
Some firmware versions return shorter C0 bodies (22 bytes or fewer), omitting this field.
The capability flag `SILKY_COOL` (0x0018) in the B5 response (§3.4) indicates whether the
unit supports this feature. Silky cool is a gentle-cooling mode that reduces draft sensation.
**Hypothesis** — not tested on own hardware.

### Alternative temperature packing in 0xC0 response:

An alternative format flag may cause the setpoint temperature to be decoded
from body byte[1] instead of byte[2]:

- **Standard format** (byte[2]): `temp = (byte[2] & 0x0F) + 16`, `half = (byte[2] >> 4) & 0x01`
  — this is the format documented above and consistent with all other sources.
- **Alternative format A** (byte[1] bits[6:1]): `temp = (byte[1] >> 2) & 0x1F` (bits[6:2]) `+ 12`,
  `half = byte[1] & 0x01` (bit 0)
- **Alternative format B** (byte[1] bits[5:1]): `temp = (byte[1] >> 1) & 0x1F` (bits[5:1]) `+ 12`,
  `half = (byte[1] >> 6) & 0x01` (bit 6)

The trigger condition for selecting between formats is not fully understood.
**Hypothesis**: these are protocol version variants (older appliances may use the
byte[1] packing). Not yet observed in own captures — treat as Hypothesis.

### Temperature Parsing with Decimal Precision:
```python
def parse_temperature(integer_byte, decimal_nibble, fahrenheits=False):
    """Parse indoor/outdoor temperature.
    integer_byte: body[11] or body[12]
    decimal_nibble: body[15] lower or upper nibble
    """
    integer = integer_byte - 50
    temp = integer / 2.0

    if not fahrenheits and decimal_nibble > 0:
        # Add decimal precision (tenths)
        if integer >= 0:
            temp = (integer // 2) + decimal_nibble * 0.1
        else:
            temp = (integer // 2) - decimal_nibble * 0.1

    if decimal_nibble >= 5:
        if integer >= 0:
            temp += 0.5
        else:
            temp -= 0.5

    return temp

indoor_temp  = parse_temperature(body[11], body[15] & 0x0F)
outdoor_temp = parse_temperature(body[12], (body[15] >> 4) & 0x0F)
```

### NeoAcheron Response Parsing (alternative offsets)
NeoAcheron strips a 0x32-byte (50-byte) network header, so their `data[0x01]` = our `body[1]`:
```
NeoAcheron    Our Body    Field
data[0x01]    body[1]     power, resume, timer, error
data[0x02]    body[2]     mode + temperature
data[0x03]    body[3]     fan speed
data[0x07]    body[7]     swing mode
data[0x08]    body[8]     cosy sleep, turbo2
data[0x09]    body[9]     eco, child sleep, etc.
data[0x0a]    body[10]    sleep, turbo, night light
data[0x0b]    body[11]    indoor temperature
data[0x0c]    body[12]    outdoor temperature
data[0x0d]    body[13]    humidity (& 0x7F)

### 4.2 Response 0xC1 — Extended (Group Pages, Power, Extended State) ← Triggered by: §3.1.2 (group page query), §3.1.3 (power query), §3.1.4.5 (extended state query)

`body[0] = 0xC1` covers multiple sub-types. **Dispatch by body[1]/body[2] first:**

| Priority | Condition | Sub-type | Triggered by |
|----------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | `body[1] == 0x21 and body[2] == 0x01` | Group page response (groups 1-5+, incl. power) | `0x41/0x81/0x01/page` or `0x41/0x21/0x01/page` query |
| 2 | `body[1] == 0x01` | Extended state sub-page 0x01 (sensors, faults) | Extended `0x41/0x21` query — community protocol research |
| 3 | `body[1] == 0x02` | Extended state sub-page 0x02 (flags, power, vanes) | Extended `0x41/0x21` query — community protocol research |
| — | other | Unknown | — |

Group page responses dispatch further by `body[3] & 0x0F` as group number (community protocol research, see community protocol research).
Group 4 (`body[3]=0x44`) is the power usage page — previously handled as a separate
top-level sub-type, now unified under the group page dispatcher.

> Do not call all 0xC1 frames "Power Response" — this is incorrect for group-page and extended-state variants.

`0xC1` group page response common header (body[1]=`0x21`, body[2]=`0x01`, body[3]=page echo):

Page 0x42 response:  C1 21 01 42  [20 data bytes]
Page 0x43 response:  C1 21 01 03  [20 data bytes]  (body[3]=0x03, not 0x43 — see Group 3 note)
Page 0x45 response:  C1 21 01 45  [16 data bytes]

#### 4.2.1 Group 1 (body[3]=0x41) — Base Run Info (R/T bus) ← Triggered by: §3.1.2

Source: own Session 1 captures (15 frames, 13 unique bodies, R/T bus, 83-second window).
Field labels from community protocol research (see community protocol research).
**Session 6 service menu ground truth** confirms T1, T3, T4 formulas and Tp encoding.
Cross-session comparison (Sessions 3–8, 329 matched pairs vs XYE byte[22]) confirms Tp.

| Offset | Bytes | Observed values | Field | Encoding | Confidence |

| body[5] | 1 | 0x00, 0x0F, 0x1C | FT — compressor target frequency (indoor target freq) | raw Hz | **Confirmed S11** (service menu FT=27 matches at t=103 s; Turbo: jumps to 90 Hz) |
| body[6] | 1 | 0x00 or 0x01 | Compressor current | raw (unit unclear) | Hypothesis |

| body[10] | 1 | varies | T1 indoor coil temp | (val−30)/2 °C (offset 30) | **Confirmed S6+S11** (S6: raw=0x42→18°C; S11: raw=78→24°C, service menu T1=24) |
| body[11] | 1 | varies | T2 temp | (val−30)/2 °C (offset 30) | **Consistent S11** (raw=90→30°C, service menu T2=29, drift ±1°C) |
| body[12] | 1 | varies | T3 outdoor coil temp | (val−50)/2 °C (offset 50) | **Confirmed S6+S11** (S11: raw=57→3.5°C, service menu T3=3, display rounds) |
| body[13] | 1 | varies | T4 outdoor ambient temp | (val−50)/2 °C (offset 50) | **Confirmed S6+S11** (S11: raw=57→3.5°C, service menu T4=3, display rounds) |
| body[14] | 1 | 0x1C–0x1E (S1); 0x37–0x4A (S3–S8) | Discharge pipe temp (Tp) | **direct integer °C** | **Confirmed** — S6: raw=0x4A=74→74°C; cross-UART: 329 pairs mean diff −0.02°C |
| body[15] | 1 | 0x00 | Outdoor DC fan stator flux | raw | Hypothesis |
| body[16] | 1 | 0x00 | Outdoor voltage (duplicate?) | raw | Hypothesis |
| body[17] | 1 | 0x00 | Indoor fan stator flux | raw | Hypothesis |
| body[18..23] | 6 | 0x00 | Beyond Group 1 fields | — | Consistent |

**Previous interpretation corrected**: body[8..9] was previously read as a single
16-bit LE value (range 991–1515). community research shows these are **two separate single-byte
fields** (outdoor voltage + indoor operating mode). Similarly, body[10..13] (previously
"Unknown — all vary independently") are four individual temperature sensor readings
(T1–T4) with different offset encodings. body[14] (previously "slow counter") is
the discharge pipe temperature — the slow increment is consistent with thermal inertia.
Tp encoding is **direct integer °C**: the outdoor unit MCU applies ucPQTempTab (NTC
thermistor lookup) internally and transmits the result. The Session 1 low values
(28–30°C) reflect cold-start warm-up; Sessions 3–8 show 6–74°C under varying load.

#### 4.2.2 Group 2 (body[3]=0x42) — Indoor Device Params (R/T bus) ← Triggered by: §3.1.2

Source: own Session 1 captures, 15 frames, 6 unique bodies.
Field labels from community protocol research (see community protocol research).
All labels **Hypothesis** — single source, not verified at field level against own captures.

```

**community research field map (Group 2)** vs own captures — **mismatch**:

Group 2 expects: body[4]=indoor set fan speed (×8 RPM), body[5]=indoor actual fan speed (×8 RPM),
body[6..8]=indoor fault bytes, body[9..11]=freq-limit bytes, body[12..13]=load state bytes,
body[14]=E2 param version, body[15..19]=child/smart-eye detection.

Own captures show: body[4..5] = values 0x4C–0x6B consistent with `(val−50)/2` temperature
encoding (13–28.5 °C), body[12] = 0x40 flag. These values **do not match** Group 2 RPM
fields (×8 would give 608–856 RPM — plausible but the temperature interpretation also
fits). The sentinel pattern (body[4]=body[5]=0x00 in 7/15 frames) is unusual for fan speed.

**Status**: community research Group 2 labels applied provisionally. The R/T bus may use a
different field layout than the Wi-Fi path for page 0x42. **Disputed** — own captures
are ambiguous; needs dedicated testing with known fan speed changes.

Previous own-capture analysis (retained for reference):

| Offset | Bytes | Observed values | Own capture label | Confidence |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| body[4] | 1 | 0x00 (sentinel) or 0x4C–0x6B | Temperature A: `(val−50)/2` °C; 0x00 = sensor unavailable | Hypothesis |
| body[5] | 1 | 0x00 (sentinel) or 0x4C–0x6B | Temperature B: `(val−50)/2` °C; 0x00 = sensor unavailable | Hypothesis |
| body[6..11] | 6 | 0x00 constant | Reserved / unused | Consistent |
| body[12] | 1 | 0x00 (sentinel) or 0x40 | Data-valid flag: 0x40 when temperature data present | Hypothesis |
| body[13] | 1 | 0x00 (sentinel) or 0x01 | Correlated with body[12]; meaning unknown | Hypothesis |
| body[14..23] | 10 | 0x00 constant | Reserved / unused | Consistent |

**Note**: `0x42/0x00` = `prevent_straight_wind` in the 0xB1 property protocol is a
**different bus protocol layer** — no direct field mapping to R/T bus group pages. **Disputed**.

#### 4.2.3 Group 3 (body[3]=0x43/0x03) — Outdoor Device Params (R/T bus) ← Triggered by: §3.1.2

Source: own Session 1 captures, 14 frames, 7 unique bodies. All responses have
body[3]=`0x03`, not `0x43` — the page ID is not echoed directly.
Field labels from community protocol research (see community protocol research).

```
Example frames (body[0..25]):
count=5  C1 21 01 03  00 00 00 00 00 08 00 1B 72 AF B3 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  (sentinel temp)

```

**body[3] anomaly explained**: body[3]=`0x03` → `0x03 & 0x0F = 3` = Group 3. The group
dispatch works correctly despite the non-echoed page ID. community research confirms the
dispatch uses `body[3] & 0x0F`, not the full byte.

**community research field map (Group 3)** vs own captures:

| Offset | Bytes | Observed | community research field | Encoding | Fit with captures | Confidence |
|--------|-------|----------|------------------|----------|-------------------|------------|
| body[4..8] | 5 | 0x00 constant | Outdoor device state 1-5 | 8-bit packed flags | Consistent (no outdoor faults) | Hypothesis |
| body[9] | 1 | 0x08 constant | Outdoor device state 6 | 8-bit packed flags | Consistent (bit3=4-way valve?) | Hypothesis |

| body[11] | 1 | 0x00–0x3E | EEV position | raw × 8 steps → 0–496 steps | 648 own frames S03–S13, valve opens wider when compressor runs; VRF manual (KJR-86S/BK) confirms ×8 encoding  | Consistent |
| body[12] | 1 | 0x72 constant | Outdoor return air temp | raw AD value (=114) | Plausible | Hypothesis |
| body[13] | 1 | 0xA9–0xB3 | Outdoor DC bus voltage | raw (169–179) | Plausible for DC bus | Hypothesis |

| body[17..23] | 7 | 0x00 | Beyond Group 3 fields | — | Consistent | — |

**Previous interpretation corrected**: body[10..11] were previously labeled as temperatures
using `(val−50)/2`. community research shows they are outdoor DC fan speed (×8 RPM) and EEV
position (×8 steps). body[12] (0x72=114) was "unknown constant" — now identified as outdoor
return air temperature (raw AD, not `(val-50)/2`). body[14] (0xB3=179) as IPM temperature
seems too high for °C — may be a raw AD value requiring a lookup table. **Disputed**.

**Note**: `0x43/0x00` = `gentle_wind_sense` / `prevent_straight_wind_flag` in 0xB1
property protocol is a **different bus protocol layer**. **Disputed**.

#### 4.2.4 Group 4 (body[3]=0x44) — Power Usage Response — BCD kWh ← Triggered by: §3.1.3

body[0] = `0xC1`, body[3] = `0x44`.

Four power fields. Encoding depends on B5 capability 0x16:
- **Cap 0x16 = 2-3**: BCD encoding. `bcd(b) = ((b >> 4) & 0xF) * 10 + (b & 0xF)`.
- **Cap 0x16 = 4-5**: Linear encoding. 4-byte big-endian uint32 / 100.0 (kWh), 3-byte uint24 / 10000.0 (kW).
- **Cap 0x16 = 0**: Q11 reports "not supported" but data is present using **linear** encoding (confirmed against external power meter).

| body offset | Field | BCD formula | Linear formula | Unit | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------------|----------------|------|-------|
| [4..7] | totalPowerConsume | `bcd[4]×10000 + bcd[5]×100 + bcd[6] + bcd[7]/100` | `uint32_be / 100` | kWh | Cumulative lifetime energy |
| [8..11] | totalRunPower | same 4-byte BCD | same linear | kWh | All zeros in own captures |
| [12..15] | curRunPower | same 4-byte BCD | same linear | kWh | All zeros in own captures |
| [16..18] | curRealTimePower | `bcd[16] + bcd[17]/100 + bcd[18]/10000` | `uint24_be / 10000` | kW | Instantaneous draw |

Note: BCD nibbles > 9 (e.g. 0xA=10, 0xD=13, 0xF=15) appear in the data and are treated
as their hex integer value by `bcd()` — effectively hexadecimal digit encoding, not strict BCD.

**Previous unknowns now decoded**: The constant pattern `26 1B ... 33 07 00 B7 88` is
actually: indoor fan runtime = 6950 min, compressor cumulative runtime = 1843 h,
max voltage = 243V, min voltage = 196V — all plausible historical counters for a unit
in service. body[5] (0x4A–0x52) previously guessed as temperature is actually the
compensated setpoint (Tsc) — a raw internal value, not `(val-50)/2`.

#### 4.2.6 Group 0 (body[3]=0x40) — Power-On / Run Time Counters

Source: community protocol research.
**Not observed in own captures.** All fields: **Hypothesis**.

`body[3] & 0x0F == 0`. Response contains three sets of day/hour/minute/second counters.

| body[] | Field | Encoding | Notes |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| [4-5] | Power-on days | 16-bit BE | Time since last power-on |
| [6] | Power-on hours | raw | |
| [7] | Power-on minutes | raw | |
| [8] | Power-on seconds | raw | |
| [9-10] | Total worked days | 16-bit BE | Cumulative lifetime |
| [11] | Total worked hours | raw | |
| [12] | Total worked minutes | raw | |
| [13] | Total worked seconds | raw | |
| [14-15] | Current worked days | 16-bit BE | Current session |
| [16] | Current worked hours | raw | |
| [17] | Current worked minutes | raw | |
| [18] | Current worked seconds | raw | |

**Cross-reference**: The A1 heartbeat (§5.2) also carries `curWorkedDay/Hour/Min` at
body[9-12], but those fields are not implemented on Q11 (always zero). Group 0 may
provide the same data via the group page path.

**Note**: Days use **16-bit big-endian** byte order — verify whether this is consistent
with the 16-bit **little-endian** used in Group 5 (indoor fan runtime, compressor time).

#### 4.2.7 Group 6 (body[3]=0x46) — Extended Diagnostics

Source: community protocol research.
**Not observed in own captures.** All fields: **Hypothesis**.

`body[3] & 0x0F == 6`. Contains historical peak values and motor control diagnostics.

| body[] | Field | Encoding | Notes |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| [4] | Max current (historical) | raw | Peak compressor current |
| [5] | Max T4 temp (historical) | raw | Peak outdoor ambient |
| [6] | Min T4 temp (historical) | raw | Lowest outdoor ambient |
| [7] | Cumulative fault count | raw | Lifetime fault counter |
| [8] | Compressor flux | raw x 8 | Stator magnetic flux |
| [9] | Fan flux | raw x 8 | Fan motor magnetic flux |
| [10] | d-axis current | raw x 64 | FOC d-axis component |

| [12] | Compressor peak current | raw | |
| [13] | PFC peak current | raw | Power factor correction |
| [14] | Fan peak current | raw | |
| [15-16] | Torque adjust angle | 16-bit LE | Motor torque compensation |
| [17] | Torque adjust value | raw x 8 | |
| [18] | AD calibration voltage 1 | raw x 16 | ADC reference calibration |

**Cross-reference**: Fields [4]-[7] (max current, max/min T4, fault count) overlap with
Extended State sub-page 0x02 (§4.3.2) body[26]-[29]. Same data, different query path.

---

#### 4.2.8 Group 11 (body[3]=0x4B) — Louver / Vane Angles

Source: community protocol research.
**Not observed in own captures.** All fields: **Hypothesis**.

`body[3] & 0x0F == 11` (0x0B). Contains vane/louver swing states and angle limits.

| body[] | Field | Encoding | Notes |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| [4] bits[1:0] | UD vane swing state | 2-bit | Up-down swing active |
| [4] bits[3:2] | LR vane swing state | 2-bit | Left-right swing active |
| [4] bits[5:4] | Top vane swing state | 2-bit | Top louver swing active |
| [5] | UD vane cool upper limit | raw % | |

| [10] | LR vane upper limit | raw % | |
| [11] | LR vane lower limit | raw % | |
| [12] | LR vane current angle | raw % | Actual position |
| [13] | Top vane upper limit | raw % | |
| [14] | Top vane lower limit | raw % | |
| [15] | Top vane current angle | raw % | Actual position |

**Cross-reference**: Vane angle fields overlap with Extended State sub-page 0x02 (§4.3.2)
body[49]-[56] (UD/LR vane cool/heat limits and current angles). Group 11 adds top vane
fields not present in sub-page 0x02.

**Dissector note**: The dissector's `group_page_names` table already lists Group 11 as
"Wind Blade Control" but no field-level parsing is implemented.

**Cross-references to Group Pages (§3.1.2)**:

| Sub-page 0x01 field | Group page equivalent | Encoding difference |
|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| T1 body[9-10] (16-bit LE x 0.01 C) | Group 1 body[10] `(val-30)/2` | Sub-page: 0.01 C precision, signed. Group 1: 0.5 C steps, offset 30 |
| T2 body[11-12] | Group 1 body[11] `(val-30)/2` | Same difference |

**Temperature encoding asymmetry**: Sub-page 0x01 uses 16-bit LE x 0.01 C (high precision,
signed), while Group 1 uses single-byte with offset-30 (T1/T2) or offset-50 (T3/T4) divided by 2
(0.5 C steps). The 0xC0 status response (§4.1) uses yet another encoding: `(raw - 50) / 2` for
both indoor and outdoor. Three different encodings for the same physical sensors.

## 5. Notifications (Mainboard → Dongle, unsolicited)

### 5.1 Notification Types

| Body type | msg_type | Name | Decode status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0xA0` | `0x05` | Heartbeat ACK | **Confirmed** — C0-format body (identical field layout to 0xC0, see section 6) |
| `0xA1` | `0x04` | Heartbeat energy/temps | **Confirmed** — full decode, see below |
| `0xA2` | `0x04` | Heartbeat device params | **Unknown** — not decoded in community protocol research  |
| `0xA3` | `0x04` | Heartbeat device params 2 | **Unknown** — not decoded in community protocol research  |
| `0xA5` | `0x04` | Heartbeat outdoor unit | **Unknown** — not decoded in community protocol research  |
| `0xA6` | `0x04` | Heartbeat network info | **Unknown** — not decoded in community protocol research  |
| `0xBB` | — | XBB sub-protocol | Used by newer "SN8" units; completely different encoding |
| `0xB0/0xB1` | `0x02/0x03` | TLV set/response | Tag-value pairs for indirect wind, breeze, fresh air, screen display |

---

### 5.2 Heartbeat 0xA1 — Energy and Temperatures (confirmed)

**Sources**: community protocol research.
**Cross-validated** against Session 9 frame `AA 2B AC 00 00 00 00 00 02 04 A1 00 01 0D 8B 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 68 3A 00 00 00 24 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 9F F0 94`.

| body[] | Reference field name (Q14) | Reference field name (Q11) | Formula | Status |
|--------|--------------|---------------|---------|--------|
| `[0]` | cmd_id | — | — | — |
| `[1..4]` | `totalPowerConsume` | (not decoded) | BCD or linear kWh (see §4.2.4 for encoding) | **Corrected** — Q11 uses linear (689 kWh), not BCD (113 kWh) |
| `[5..8]` | `totalRunPower` | (not decoded) | same encoding as [1..4] | Consistent — always 0 on Q11 |
| `[9..12]` | `curWorkedDay/Hour/Min` | days/hours/mins | 16-bit BE days + byte hours + byte mins | **Not implemented on Q11** — always 0 |
| `[13]` | `t1Temp` | `indoorTemperatureValue` | `(raw−50)/2`, skip 0x00/0xFF | **Confirmed** |
| `[14]` | `t4Temp` | `outdoorTemperatureValue` | `(raw−50)/2`, skip 0x00/0xFF | **Confirmed** |
| `[15..16]` | `pm25Value` | (not decoded) | 16-bit BE µg/m³ | Consistent — always 0 on Q11 |
| `[17]` | `curHum` | (not decoded) | integer % | Consistent — always 0 on Q11 |
| `[18]` | (skipped Q14) | `smallIndoor`[3:0]/`smallOutdoor`[7:4] | nibble | **Unknown on Q11** — values random |
| `[19]` | `lightAdValue` | (not decoded) | raw ADC | Consistent — always 0 on Q11 |

**Cross-validation (55 frames, Sessions 1-9):**

- `totalPowerConsume` unit is **kWh** (not Watts). Q11 uses **linear encoding** (uint32/100): Sessions 1 (~688 kWh) and 8 (~690 kWh). Previous BCD interpretation (111-113 kWh) was incorrect — corrected 2026-04-06 against external power meter. Cross-session trend monotonically increasing — consistent with a lifetime cumulative energy counter.
- `currentWorkTime[9..12]` is **not implemented on Q11** — all 55 A1 frames contain `00 00 00 00`, including Session 7 (756 s duration). The field is documented in community protocol research but Q11 firmware does not populate it.
- `byte[18]` is **not a reliable fractional temperature** on Q11. Values cycle through `0x00, 0x04, 0x94, 0x83, 0x90, 0x10...` in frames where T1/T4 are constant. True meaning unknown.
- `T1/T4` readings are physically plausible in all sessions. Session 9 correctly shows `T4 = 0xFF` (N/A) at t = 22 s post-boot, recovering to 4.5 °C by t = 43 s.

### 5.3 Heartbeat 0xA0 — Status Echo

msg_type=0x05, body[0]=0xA0. Uses the same field layout as the 0xC0 status response
(§4.1). Acts as a periodic status push from the mainboard without a preceding query.
**Confirmed** — consistent across community protocol research.

---

### 5.4 Heartbeats 0xA2, 0xA3, 0xA5, 0xA6 — Unknown

All use msg_type=0x04. Present in own captures but **no source decodes them**:
- **0xA2**: Heartbeat device params — field structure **Unknown**
- **0xA3**: Heartbeat device params 2 — field structure **Unknown**
- **0xA5**: Heartbeat outdoor unit — field structure **Unknown**
- **0xA6**: Heartbeat network info — field structure **Unknown**

Source: community protocol research  —
confirmed absent from all Findings. Not in dudanov, midea-local, or any other open-source
implementation examined.

**Dongle handling**: The dongle forwards all msg_type=0x04 frames opaquely to the cloud
without inspecting the body (community research). Own captures show A5 and A6 contain non-zero
data (unlike A2/A3 which are all zeros). See `uart_examples.md` for captured frames.

---

### 5.5 Network Status (msg_type=0x63 / 0x0D)

- **0x63**: AC polls dongle for network status. Dongle responds with a 20-byte body.
- **0x0D**: Network initialization — sent by dongle at boot (see §6.1).

**MSG 0x63 response body** (20 bytes, entirely built by dongle):

Source: community protocol research. **Consistent**.

| body[] | Field | Values |
|--------|-------|--------|
| [0] | Connection status | 0x00=not connected, 0x01=connected |
| [1] | WiFi state | 0=off, 1=connected, 3=SoftAP |
| [2] | WiFi mode | raw |
| [3..6] | IP address | 4 bytes, **little-endian** byte order (see below) |
| [7] | Fixed | 0xFF |
| [8] | Signal strength | 0=error, 1=none, 2=fair, 3=good, 4=excellent, 7=auto |
| [9..15] | DHCP/DNS data | 7 bytes from network subsystem |
| [16] | Connection detail | 0=none, 1=WiFi off+DHCP, 2=connected no IP, 3=fully connected |

**IP address byte order — Confirmed (Session 7):**
The IP is stored in **little-endian** (LSB first). Example from own capture:
```
body[3..6] = 04 B3 A8 C0
             ↓  ↓  ↓  ↓
IP:        192.168.179.4   (read bytes[6].bytes[5].bytes[4].bytes[3])
```
This is the dongle's actual local IP on the WiFi network (192.168.179.x subnet).
Reading as big-endian would give `4.179.168.192` — not a valid local address.

---

### 5.6 Device Identification (msg_type=0x07)

On startup, the dongle sends a device identification query (body = `{0x00}`, LEN=11).
The AC responds with msg_type=0x07 containing the serial number (up to 32 bytes ASCII).

**Side effect** (community research): The dongle reads frame header fields from the response —
frame[2] (TYPE), frame[7] (PROTO), frame[8] (SUB) — and stores them. All future
outgoing frames built by the dongle use these values in their headers.

If no response: dongle generates fallback SN from WiFi MAC address:
`000000P0000000Q1<MAC_HEX>0000`.

Source: community protocol research. **Consistent**.

---

### 5.7 RAC Serial (msg_type=0x65)

Alternative SN query for multi-split / VRF systems where the RAC controller responds
instead of the main AC unit. Body = 20 bytes zeros, LEN=30.

The dongle tries MSG 0x07 first; if no response, tries 0x65. A pending 0x07 also accepts
a 0x65 response and vice versa. Same SN fallback if neither responds.

Source: community protocol research. **Consistent**.

---

### 5.8 0xBB Sub-Protocol (SN8 / newer devices)

A completely different body encoding used by newer "SN8" generation devices. Temperature
precision at 1/100 C rather than 0.5 C steps. **Not Covered** — requires dedicated analysis.
Primary reference: `chemelli74/midea-local`.

---

## 6. Handshake and Initialization

### 6.1 Boot Sequence

The dongle performs the following startup sequence when powered on:

1. **Model query** (MSG 0xA0): Dongle sends msg_type=0xA0, frame length=30, body=zeros.
   AC responds with `body[2] = sub_type_low`, `body[3] = sub_type_high`.
   Model number = `body[2] | (body[3] << 8)`. For AC (0xAC): model = 0xACAC = 44204.
   Timeout: 300 ms, 6 retries.

2. **Serial number query** (MSG 0x07): Dongle sends msg_type=0x07, body=`{0x00}`, LEN=11.
   AC responds with SN in body (up to 32 bytes ASCII).
   **Side effect**: Dongle reads frame[2] (TYPE), frame[7] (PROTO), frame[8] (SUB) from
   the response header and stores them — all future outgoing frames use these values.
   If no response: fallback SN from WiFi MAC: `000000P0000000Q1<MAC_HEX>0000`.

3. **RAC serial query** (MSG 0x65): Alternative to MSG 0x07 for multi-split/VRF systems.
   Dongle tries 0x07 first; if no response, tries 0x65. A pending 0x07 also accepts a
   0x65 response and vice versa. Same SN fallback if neither responds.

4. **Network init** (MSG 0x0D): Dongle announces its presence on the UART bus.
   body[4..7] = dongle's current local IP address. Also sent on WiFi pairing mode entry.

5. **Capabilities query** (CMD 0xB5): Dongle queries device capabilities.
   B5 response determines which features are available (see §3.4).

6. **Initial status query** (CMD 0x41): First status poll.

7. **Network status** (MSG 0x63): Dongle reports network state to AC every ~2 minutes.

**Restart trigger** (MSG 0x0F / 0x11): If the dongle receives MSG 0x0F or 0x11 with
`body[0] == 0x80 AND body[1] == 0x40`, it sends MSG 0x16 to the AC
(body = {0x02, 0x02, 0x00, 0x00}) and then restarts itself.

**Version info** (MSG 0x87 / 0xC1 from AC): Both trigger the same 9-byte hardcoded
response from the dongle (version type, hardware/firmware version, protocol version).

Source: community protocol research. **Consistent**.

### 6.2 Frame Processing

1. **Start detection**: Wait for 0xAA byte, then read `length` byte to know total frame size
2. **Frame reading**: Read `length + 1` total bytes (0xAA + length bytes)
3. **Validation**: Verify CRC8 and checksum before processing
4. **Polling**: Dongle sends periodic 0x41 status queries (~30 s interval); AC responds with 0xC0

### 6.3 Appliance Types

The Midea UART protocol supports multiple appliance types, identified by byte[2] of the
frame. The AC type (0xAC) is the focus of this document.

| Type (hex) | Name | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| 0x13 | Light | |
| 0x26 | Bathroom Master | |
| 0x34 | Sink Dishwasher | |

| 0xB4 | Fridge | |
| 0xBF | Humidifier | |
| 0xC3 | Heat Pump WiFi Controller | |
| 0xCA | Fridge (alt) | |
| 0xCC | MDV WiFi Controller | VRF control |

| 0xED | Water Drinking Appliance | |
| 0xFA | Fan | |
| 0xFB | Electric Heater | |
| 0xFC | Air Purifier | |
| 0xFD | Humidifier (alt) | |

## 7. Frame Examples

### Query status (full 34-byte frame):
```
AA 21 AC 8D 00 00 00 00 00 03
41 81 00 FF 03 FF 00 02 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
03 XX YY ZZ
```
Where XX = msg_id, YY = CRC8, ZZ = checksum

### Set power ON, mode=cool, temp=24C, fan=auto (full 36-byte frame):
```
AA 23 AC 8F 00 00 00 00 00 02
40 43 48 66 00 00 00 30 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 XX YY ZZ
```
Byte 11: 0x43 = beep(0x40) | always(0x02) | power(0x01)
Byte 12: 0x48 = cool(2<<5) | (24-16=8)
Byte 13: 0x66 = fan_auto(102)
XX = msg_id, YY = CRC8, ZZ = checksum

For frame examples covering individual MSG_TYPE and body[0] combinations, see the per-session `findings.md` files under `HVAC-shark-dumps/Midea-XtremeSaveBlue-logicanalyzer/Session N/`.

## 8. Cross-Bus Data Flow

### 8.1 Bus Data Rates

| Bus | Baud | Encoding | ms/byte | 38-byte frame TX |
|-----|------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Display↔Mainboard (CN1) | 9600 | 8N1 | 1.04 ms | ~40 ms |
| UART wifi dongle (CN3) | 9600 | 8N1 | 1.04 ms | ~40 ms |
| R/T pin (CN1) | **2400** | 8N1 | 4.17 ms | **~158 ms** |
| HA/HB RS-485 | **48000** | 8N1 nibble-pair | 0.21 ms | ~8 ms (physical) |

R/T at 2400 baud is 4× slower than UART — a 38-byte R/T frame takes **158 ms**
to transmit. This must be accounted for when correlating timestamps across buses:
the timestamp marks the first byte, but the last byte arrives ~158 ms later.

HA/HB uses nibble-pair encoding (2 physical bytes per logical byte, XOR 0xFF),
so the effective logical data rate is ~2400 bytes/s — matching R/T throughput.

### 8.2 Mode Field: User Setting vs Actual Sub-Mode

The "Mode" field in C0 Status and 0x40 Set commands carries the **user-requested**
mode (e.g., Auto), not the mainboard's actual operating sub-mode (e.g., Heat).
In Auto mode, the mainboard independently selects the active sub-mode based on
temperature conditions.

To determine the real operating mode, read the display-mainboard internal bus
or the C1 Group 1 "indoor operating mode" field.

For device-specific observations (relay timing, polling rates, cross-bus mode
mismatch examples), see [device_xtremesaveblue.md](../devices/device_xtremesaveblue.md).

## Appendix A — Cross-Source Consistency

Sources compared: `dudanov/MideaUART` (C++), `chemelli74/midea-local` (Python), `NeoAcheron/midea-ac-py` (Python), `reneklootwijk/node-mideahvac` (JS).

---

### A.1 Confirmed Matches (all sources agree)

| Field | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Start byte | `0xAA` | Universal |
| Appliance type | `0xAC` | Universal |
| SYNC byte | `LENGTH ^ APPLIANCE_TYPE` | Universal |
| CRC-8 table | identical 256-entry table | All sources carry the same table verbatim |
| Checksum formula | `(256 - sum(frame[1:])) & 0xFF` | Universal |
| Fan speed values | AUTO=102, SILENT=20, LOW=40, MED=60, HIGH=80, TURBO=100 | Universal |
| Mode encoding | bits[7:5] of body[2]; 1=Auto,2=Cool,3=Dry,4=Heat,5=Fan | Universal |
| Swing nibble | body[7] lower nibble; OFF=0, V=0x0C, H=0x03, BOTH=0x0F | Universal |
| ECO in SET (0x40) | body[9] bit 7 (0x80) | dudanov + midea-local agree |
| Turbo in SET/response | body[8] bit 5 AND body[10] bit 1 (both locations active) | dudanov + midea-local agree |
| Frost protection | body[21] bit 7 (0x80) | All agree |
| Indoor temp | body[11]: `(val - 50) / 2.0` | All agree |
| Outdoor temp | body[12]: `(val - 50) / 2.0` | All agree |
| New temp field | body[13] bits[4:0]: `val + 12` if > 0, overrides byte 2 | dudanov + our doc agree |
| Capabilities frame | record structure: ID(1B) + type(1B) + len(1B) + data | All agree |
| Capability IDs 0x0212–0x022C | values match across all sources | |

---

### A.2 Conflicts and Deviations

#### ⚠️ ECO mode — C0 response body[9]: BIT MISMATCH

| Source | Bit mask | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| This document (section 6) | `0x10` (bit 4) | Correctly documented |
| **`response.py` in this project** | `0x80` (bit 7) | **WRONG — confirmed bug** |
| `dudanov/MideaUART` | `0x10` (bit 4) | `m_getValue(9, 16)` where 16=0x10 |
| `midea-local` | `0x10` (bit 4) | `body[9] & 0x10` |

**The response parser reads bit 7 but the correct bit is bit 4. This causes ECO mode to never be detected from a real AC response. Requires hardware verification before fixing.**

Note: SET command (0x40) correctly uses bit 7 (0x80) for ECO — the protocol uses different bit positions for set vs. response.

---

#### ✅ CAPABILITY_MODES (0x0214) — **Consistent** (dudanov and node-mideahvac agree)

Source: dudanov/MideaUART `Capabilities.cpp` and reneklootwijk/node-mideahvac `B5.js` — both
contain identical switch-case logic. **This document's earlier table was wrong.**

| Value | Correct interpretation (both sources agree) |
|---|---|
| 0 | cool=yes, dry=yes, auto=yes, heat=**no** |
| 1 | all four modes (cool, heat, dry, auto) |
| 2 | heat=yes, auto=yes, cool=**no**, dry=**no** |
| 3 | cool=yes only (heat=no, dry=no, auto=no) |
| 4–9 | heat variants (reneklootwijk/node-mideahvac only) — not yet documented here |

---

#### ✅ CAPABILITY_TURBO (0x021A) — **Consistent** (dudanov and node-mideahvac agree)

Source: dudanov/MideaUART and reneklootwijk/node-mideahvac — identical switch-case logic.
**This document's earlier table was wrong.**

| Value | turboCool | turboHeat |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | true | false |
| 1 | true | true |
| 2 | false | false |
| 3 | false | true |

---

#### ✅ CAPABILITY_FAN_SPEED_CONTROL (0x0210) — **Consistent** (dudanov and node-mideahvac agree)

| Source | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| dudanov/MideaUART | `val != 1` → supported |
| reneklootwijk/node-mideahvac | `val != 1` → supported |

Both sources agree: `val=1` means NOT supported. This document previously documented `val != 0`
— **that was wrong.** Corrected.

---

#### ✅ CAPABILITY_UNIT_CHANGEABLE (0x0222) — **Consistent** (dudanov and node-mideahvac agree)

| Source | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| dudanov/MideaUART | `!val` → changeable (val=0 means changeable) |
| reneklootwijk/node-mideahvac | `val === 0` → changeable |

Both sources agree: `val=0` means unit IS changeable. This document previously documented
the inverse — **that was wrong.** Corrected.

---

#### ✅ CAPABILITY_TEMPERATURES (0x0225) — **Consistent** (dudanov and node-mideahvac agree)

| Source | Encoding |
|---|---|
| dudanov/MideaUART | raw × 0.5 = °C |
| reneklootwijk/node-mideahvac | raw / 2 = °C |

Both sources agree: raw bytes must be multiplied by 0.5 to get °C. This document previously
documented raw = direct °C — **that was wrong.** Corrected. A raw value of 32 = 16°C.

---

#### ⚠️ Display state — C0 response body[14]: inverted interpretation

| Source | ON condition |
|---|---|
| This document | `body[14] & 0x70 == 0x70` (bits[6:4] all set) |
| midea-local | `(body[14] >> 4 & 0x7) != 0x07` (bits[6:4] NOT all set) AND power is on |

These are directly contradictory. midea-local also gates display state on power status.

---

#### ℹ️ Fan speed — hardware variants

`dudanov/MideaUART` contains the following comment in `StatusData.cpp`:

> *"some ACs return 30 for LOW and 50 for MEDIUM. Note though, in appMode, this device still uses 40/60"*

Not all units consistently return the documented fan speed values. Parsers should handle 30→40 and 50→60 substitution defensively.

---

#### ℹ️ Query command body[4:5] — minor variant

| Source | body[4] | body[5] |
|---|---|---|
| dudanov / NeoAcheron | `0x03` | `0xFF` |
| midea-local | `0x00` | `0x00` |

Functional impact unknown — the AC likely ignores these bytes in a query. Both variants appear to work in practice.

---

#### ℹ️ Power query body length — significant variant

| Source | Body length | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| dudanov | 23 bytes | Full padding to 0x00 |
| midea-local | 6 bytes | `[0x41, 0x21, 0x01, 0x44, 0x00, 0x01]` — truncated |

Functional impact unknown. Both variants are in active use.

---

#### ℹ️ C1 power response — subbody type discrimination

midea-local distinguishes body[3] as a subbody type discriminator:
- `0x44`: total energy consumption at body[4:8], current consumption at body[12:16], realtime power at body[16:19]
- `0x40`: not yet documented

This document only covers the `0x44` format (bytes 16–18 BCD). Additionally, midea-local implements three parsing methods (BCD, binary, raw integer) and treats the format as device-dependent. The single-format BCD approach in section 7 may not work on all units.

---

#### ℹ️ Display toggle command — body[1] variant

| Source | body[1] | body[1] meaning |
|---|---|---|
| dudanov | `0x61` | fixed sub-command |
| midea-local | `0x02` or `0x42` | base + optional prompt_tone bit |

Different sub-command bytes. Both are in active use across different device generations.

### B.1 Source Stability Estimates

Ratings reflect breadth of protocol coverage, implementation quality, cross-source agreement,
and apparent maintenance activity. Scale: `0` (limited) → `+++` (comprehensive).
The goal is to identify which sources are most suitable as a protocol reference.

```yaml
sources:

  dudanov/MideaUART:
    language: C++
    stability: +++
    protocol_ref_value: high
    notes: >
      Strongly typed, well-structured, widely deployed in ESPHome ecosystem.
      Good for low-level frame and capability detail. Actively maintained.

  chemelli74/midea-local:
    language: Python
    stability: +++
    protocol_ref_value: high
    notes: >
      Most complete coverage of all sources. Handles multiple device generations,
      sub-protocols (XBB, B0/B1), and edge cases. Best single reference for
      newer devices and full feature set.

  reneklootwijk/node-mideahvac:
    language: JavaScript
    stability: ++
    protocol_ref_value: medium
    notes: >
      Good documentation and reasonable coverage. Useful cross-check for
      command construction. Moderate maintenance activity.

  NeoAcheron/midea-ac-py:
    language: Python
    stability: +
    protocol_ref_value: low-medium
    notes: >
      Functional but older. Field offsets appear shifted due to a network-layer
      header being included in its frame model — care needed when cross-referencing.

  reneklootwijk/midea-uart:
    language: C++
    stability: +
    protocol_ref_value: low-medium
    notes: >
      ESP8266 focused. Useful for low-level framing detail but limited in scope.
      Overlaps significantly with dudanov.

  yitsushi/midea-air-condition:
    language: Ruby
    stability: 0
    protocol_ref_value: low
    notes: >
      Niche language. Limited cross-validation possible. Likely unmaintained.
      Only useful as a basic consistency check.
```

### B.2 Findings Summary

Status key:
- `BUG` — confirmed implementation error in this project
- `CONFLICT` — sources disagree; hardware verification required

    topic: ECO bit in C0 response
    doc_ref: "Section 6, body[9]"
    code_ref: "response.py:131"
    status: BUG
    sources_agree: [dudanov, midea-local]
    detail: >
      response.py uses 0x80 (bit 7); correct value is 0x10 (bit 4).
      ECO mode is never detected from real AC responses as a result.
      The SET command (0x40) correctly uses bit 7 — the protocol intentionally
      uses different bit positions for set vs. response. Verify on hardware before fixing.

    topic: CAPABILITY_MODES (0x0214) encoding
    doc_ref: "Section 12.2"
    status: RESOLVED
    sources_agree: [dudanov, node-mideahvac]
    detail: >
      Previously marked CONFLICT. dudanov/MideaUART and reneklootwijk/node-mideahvac
      agree on identical switch-case logic. This document's table was wrong.
      Correct: 0=cool+dry+auto(no heat), 1=all four, 2=heat+auto, 3=cool only.
      Section 8 table and 12.2 conflict block updated accordingly.

  - id: 3
    topic: CAPABILITY_TURBO (0x021A) value mapping
    doc_ref: "Section 12.2"
    status: RESOLVED
    sources_agree: [dudanov, node-mideahvac]
    detail: >
      Previously marked CONFLICT. Both sources agree.
      Correct: 0=cool-only, 1=both, 2=neither, 3=heat-only.
      This document's earlier table was wrong. Section 8 and 12.2 updated.

  - id: 4
    topic: CAPABILITY_FAN_SPEED_CONTROL (0x0210) logic
    doc_ref: "Section 12.2"
    status: RESOLVED
    sources_agree: [dudanov, node-mideahvac]
    detail: >
      Previously marked CONFLICT. Both sources agree: val != 1 → supported.
      This document previously said val != 0 — that was wrong. Corrected.

  - id: 5
    topic: CAPABILITY_UNIT_CHANGEABLE (0x0222) logic
    doc_ref: "Section 12.2"
    status: RESOLVED
    sources_agree: [dudanov, node-mideahvac]
    detail: >
      Previously marked CONFLICT. Both sources agree: val=0 → changeable (!val).
      This document previously said the inverse — that was wrong. Corrected.

    doc_ref: "Section 12.2"
    status: RESOLVED
    sources_agree: [dudanov, node-mideahvac]
    detail: >
      Previously marked CONFLICT. Both sources agree: raw × 0.5 = °C.
      This document previously said raw = direct °C — that was wrong. Corrected.
      A raw value of 32 = 16°C, not 32°C.

    topic: Display state — C0 body[14] bits[6:4]
    doc_ref: "Section 6"
    status: CONFLICT
    sources_disagree: [this_doc, midea-local]
    detail: >
      this_doc:    bits[6:4] == 0x7 → display ON.
      midea-local: bits[6:4] != 0x7 → display ON (inverted), also gated on power ON.

    topic: Fan speed hardware variants (30/50 instead of 40/60)
    doc_ref: "Section 4, Section 6"
    status: VARIANT
    source: dudanov
    detail: >
      Some units return 30 for LOW and 50 for MEDIUM in responses.
      Commands should still use 40/60. Defensive remapping recommended in parser.

  - id: 9
    topic: Query command body[4:5]
    doc_ref: "Section 4"
    status: VARIANT
    sources: [dudanov/NeoAcheron → 0x03/0xFF, midea-local → 0x00/0x00]
    detail: >
      Functional impact unknown. AC likely ignores these bytes in a query frame.

  - id: 10
    topic: Power query body length
    doc_ref: "Section 4"
    status: VARIANT
    sources: [dudanov → 23 bytes, midea-local → 6 bytes]
    detail: Both are in active use. Shorter form may be safer for compatibility.

  - id: 11
    topic: C1 power response — subbody type discrimination
    doc_ref: "Section 7"
    status: INCOMPLETE
    detail: >
      Only subbody type 0x44 is documented here. Type 0x40 exists but is undocumented.
      midea-local implements three separate parsing methods (BCD, binary, raw integer)
      depending on device type. Single-format BCD will not work on all units.

  - id: 12
    topic: Display toggle command body[1]
    doc_ref: "Section 4"
    status: VARIANT
    sources: [dudanov → 0x61, midea-local → 0x02/0x42]
    detail: Corresponds to different device generations. Both observed in the field.

    topic: XBB sub-protocol (SN8 / newer units)
    doc_ref: "Section 12.3"
    status: NOT_COVERED
    detail: >
      Entirely different body encoding for newer devices. Temperature at 1/100°C precision.
      Requires dedicated analysis; midea-local is the primary reference.

])
```

### NeoAcheron set_command properties (frame-absolute offsets):
```python
# Power:     frame[0x0B] bit 0
# Beep:      frame[0x0B] & 0x42 (bits 1 and 6)
# Mode:      frame[0x0C] bits [7:5]
# Temp:      frame[0x0C] bits [4:0] (bit4=0.5, bits[3:0]=temp&0xF | (temp<<4)&0x10)
# Fan:       frame[0x0D] = speed value
# Swing:     frame[0x11] bits [3:0]
# Eco:       frame[0x13] = 0xFF (on) or 0x00 (off)
# Turbo:     frame[0x14] = 0x02 (on) or 0x00 (off)
```

### Finalize command:
```python
def finalize(cmd):
    cmd[0x1D] = crc8(cmd[16:])   # CRC over bytes 16 onward
    cmd[0x01] = len(cmd)          # length field
    return cmd
```

| OQ-07 | Display ON bit inversion | §4.1 | Disputed | This doc says bits==0x7=ON; midea-local says bits!=0x7=ON. Needs hardware test |
| OQ-08 | Group 2 captures vs community research field mismatch | §3.1.2 | Disputed | Own R/T captures show temps where community research expects RPM |
| OQ-09 | ~~Extension board 0x93 field meanings~~ | §3.3 | **Partially resolved** | body[1] = bus adapter flags (bit 5=window contact, bit 7=periodic), body[3] = operational state (0x84=run, 0x04=CP, 0x00=off, boot stages), body[4] = FM indicator. See `analysis_0x93_extension_board.md`. Remaining: body[5..20] request payload, body[4..28] response operational data |
| OQ-10 | C1 power subbody type 0x40 | §4.2.1 | Not Covered | Only 0x44 format documented; 0x40 exists but undocumented |
| OQ-11 | Display toggle body[1] variant | §3.1.5 | Variant | dudanov=0x61, midea-local=0x02/0x42; device generation dependent |
